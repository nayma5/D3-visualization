# AI Job Dataset Visualization — D3.js

This project is my Individual Assignment 3 for the Information Visualization course.  
It visualizes the **average salary by experience level** using a D3.js bar chart.

## Dataset
The dataset includes AI-related job postings with:
- `experience_level` (EN, MI, SE, EX)  
- `salary_usd` (cleaned and converted to numbers)

Data is grouped to compute the average salary per experience level.

## Visualization
A bar chart created with **D3.js v7**
featuring:
- X-axis: Experience Level  
- Y-axis: Average Salary (USD)  
- Color-coded bars  
- Tooltip on hover  
- Smooth animated transitions
